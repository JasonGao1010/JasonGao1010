# Figure design references

The SERVE method diagram (`serve.png`) is reproduced from [SERVE](https://github.com/JasonGao1010/SERVE). Layer stacks, tensor
grids and attention blocks follow the conventions illustrated by ML Visuals.
The layout and network connections are specific to the current model.
The input point cloud is the original STU training scan
`train/206/velodyne/000224.bin`, the middle frame of the 449-scan sequence.
The display retains all measured points within 2.5–35 m range and -3–8 m
height, without label filtering, interpolation, or model inference. Colors
represent height. Density curves remain schematic.
